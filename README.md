```

### Write a query to calculate the total sales amount for each product.

```
SELECT productid, SUM(totalamount) AS Total_Sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY productID
```
 |productid| Total_Sales|

 |1       |        5000|
 |2       |       70007|

 |4       |         50|
 |5       |        100|


SELECT c.CustomerID, SUM(s.quantity * p.price) AS total_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN products p 
ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
INNER JOIN customers c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1 ;

   - Write a query to find the total number of products sold in each category.
